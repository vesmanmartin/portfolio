2. About Me

I am Vesman Martin, a dedicated cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in penetration testing, threat and vulnerability management, and application security. Over the past years, I have successfully discovered 20+ critical vulnerabilities across platforms like Adidas, Nykaa, and Xfinity Comcast, contributing to safer digital environments.

My expertise spans enterprise security, AI-driven solutions, and emerging technologies. I am particularly passionate about Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM), exploring how these tools can enhance security automation and technology innovation.
